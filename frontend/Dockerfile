# Frontend Dockerfile - React/Vite Application
# Multi-stage build for optimized production image
#
# Build Instructions:
#   docker build --build-arg VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.staging.stackyn.com -t stackyn-frontend .
#
# Deployment Notes:
#   - VITE_API_BASE_URL must be set at build time (not runtime)
#   - The build process compiles React/TypeScript to static files
#   - Production build is served using 'serve' static file server
#   - SPA routing is supported via serve's -s flag
#
# Migration Notes:
#   - Migrated from Create React App to Vite for faster builds
#   - Build output is in /app/dist directory
#   - Port 3000 is exposed for Traefik routing
